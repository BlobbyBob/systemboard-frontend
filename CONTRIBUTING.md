## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Added feature to API

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Added feature to API, enabling the frontend to present the user advanced features

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.


### Is it of good quality

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It reads well
* For english language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

* To provide a platform for boulderers from the University of Bonn to track and share their boulders.
* That the platform is usable for users without technical backgrounds.
* To be used as a blueprint to develop similar systems for other bouldering gyms
